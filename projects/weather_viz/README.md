## Visualizations

### Hourly Temperature

![Hourly Temperature](reports/visualizations/hourly_temperature.png)

This plot shows the hourly temperature forecast for Cleveland, OH over the next 7 days. The y-axis represents the temperature in Celsius (Â°C), and the x-axis represents the time in hourly intervals.

### Hourly Wind Speed

![Hourly Wind Speed](reports/visualizations/wind_plot.png)

This plot shows the hourly wind speed forecast for Cleveland, OH over the next 7 days. The y-axis represents the wind speed in kilometers per hour (km/h), and the x-axis represents the time in hourly intervals.

### Hourly Precipitation

![Hourly Precipitation](reports/visualizations/precipitation_plot.png)

This plot shows the hourly precipitation forecast for Cleveland, OH over the next 7 days. The y-axis represents the precipitation in millimeters (mm), and the x-axis represents the time in hourly intervals. The precipitation is visualized using a bar chart.
