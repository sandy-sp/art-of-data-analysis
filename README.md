## Overview

Welcome to **Art of Data Analysis**, a curated portfolio of end-to-end data analysis projects. This repository showcases how raw data is transformed into actionable insights and compelling visual stories using Python, SQL, and modern data visualization tools. Each project demonstrates a specific skillset in the data analysis pipeline—from data ingestion to storytelling.

Whether it's identifying patterns, making predictions, or building interactive dashboards, the focus is on clarity, efficiency, and insight.

## Projects Included

### 1. ✨ Weather Forecast Visualizer ([Live App](https://art-of-data-analysis-weather-viz.streamlit.app/))
An interactive **Streamlit** dashboard that fetches and visualizes hourly/daily weather forecasts using the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/). Features include:

- Forecast by ZIP code (U.S.) with location validation
- Interactive Plotly charts for temperature, humidity, wind & precipitation
- Combined temperature & humidity analysis
- CSV/Excel export of forecast data

**Stack**: Streamlit, Plotly, Pandas, Requests, Openpyxl, Pgeocode

**Run Locally**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sandy-sp/art_of_data_analysis_projects_weather_viz.git
cd art_of_data_analysis_projects_weather_viz/projects/weather_viz
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

### 2. 🌍 USGS Earthquake Visualizer
A geographic data app that uses the **USGS Earthquake API** to map recent earthquakes within country borders. Key features:

- Country-specific filtering using GeoPandas + Natural Earth shapefiles
- Interactive Folium map with:
  - Magnitude-based marker size
  - Depth-based marker color (legend included)
  - Marker clustering for performance
- Advanced filtering: magnitude, date, record limits
- CSV export of filtered dataset
- Streamlit sidebar UI with caching optimizations

**Stack**: Python 3.9+, Streamlit, GeoPandas, Folium, Requests, Pandas

**Run Locally**:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd earthquake-visualizer
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app/main.py
```

Refer to the project README for shapefile download and setup instructions.
